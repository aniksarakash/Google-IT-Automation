    "The compare_strings function is supposed to compare just the alphanumeric content of two strings, ignoring upper vs lower case and punctuation. But something is not working. Fill in the code to try to find the problems, then fix the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The provided compare_strings function aims to compare two strings disregarding case and punctuation. To make it work correctly, we need to ensure that all non-alphanumeric characters are removed and both strings are converted to lower case for comparison.Let's analyze the current function, adding a debug line to print the state of string1 and string2 after processing. The debug line will help us understand if the strings are being processed as expected.\n",
    "This function transforms the strings by converting them to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters. It then prints the resulting strings and compares them. The print statements will show you how each string is processed, allowing you to verify whether the process is working correctly."

You've seen some of them used in the dow function, which returns the day of the week for a specific date. We'll use them again in the next_date function, which takes the date_string parameter in the format of \"year-month-day\", and uses the add_year function to calculate the next year that this date will occur (it's 4 years later for the 29th of February during Leap Year, and 1 year later for all other dates).

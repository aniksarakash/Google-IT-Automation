This is a conditional statement in Puppet's Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that checks whether the current node (machine) is a virtual machine or a physical one.

The `if $facts['is_virtual']` condition checks the value of the 'is_virtual' fact. Facts in Puppet are key-value data pairs that represent some aspect of a node's state, such as its IP address, uptime, operating system, or whether it's a virtual machine.

Here is the breakdown of the Puppet DSL code:

```puppet
if $facts['is_virtual'] {
  package { 'smartmontools':
    ensure => purged,
  }
} else {
  package { 'smartmontools':
    ensure => installed,
  }
}
```

- If the 'is_virtual' fact is true (i.e., the node is a virtual machine), the code block inside the first set of curly braces `{...}` gets executed. This block includes a Puppet resource declaration for a package named 'smartmontools', specifying it should be 'purged'. This means that the 'smartmontools' package and its configuration files should be removed from the system.

- If the 'is_virtual' fact is false (i.e., the node is a physical machine), the 'else' block gets executed. This block includes another package resource declaration for 'smartmontools', but this time specifying it should be 'installed'. This means that the 'smartmontools' package should be installed on the system.

In summary, this Puppet DSL code checks whether the node is virtual or physical. If it's virtual, it removes 'smartmontools'. If it's physical, it installs 'smartmontools'. 'smartmontools' is typically used for monitoring and controlling storage devices, so it makes sense that you would want it installed on physical machines (which have direct access to their storage hardware) but not on virtual ones.

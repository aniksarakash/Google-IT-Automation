This is a resource declaration in Puppet's Domain-Specific Language (DSL) using the `exec` type, which is used to execute system commands. 

Here is the breakdown of the Puppet DSL code:

```puppet
exec { 'move example file':
  command => 'mv /home/user/example.txt /home/user/Desktop',
  onlyif  => 'test -e /home/user/example.txt',
}
```

- `exec { 'move example file': ... }` - This declares an `exec` resource named 'move example file'. The name is arbitrary and is used to uniquely identify this resource.

- `command => 'mv /home/user/example.txt /home/user/Desktop',` - This is the command that Puppet should execute. In this case, it's moving the file `example.txt` from `/home/user` to `/home/user/Desktop`.

- `onlyif => 'test -e /home/user/example.txt',` - This is a conditional statement that tells Puppet to only execute the command if the provided test returns true. Here, it checks if the `example.txt` file exists in `/home/user`. The command `test -e /home/user/example.txt` returns true if the file exists and false if it doesn't.

Now, let's talk about idempotence in this context. 

Idempotence refers to the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. In Puppet, a resource declaration is idempotent if multiple applications of it don't change the state of the system after the first application.

In this particular `exec` resource declaration, the 'onlyif' parameter helps make the action idempotent. If the `example.txt` file doesn't exist in the source directory, the `mv` command won't be executed. So, even if Puppet applies this resource multiple times, it won't result in an error or an unintended state after the file is moved the first time.
